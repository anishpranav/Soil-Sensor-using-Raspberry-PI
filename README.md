# Soil-Sensor-using-Raspberry-PI
Soil moisture monitoring is essential for optimizing water use in agriculture, gardening, and
plant care. Inadequate moisture can lead to plant stress, reduced yields, or plant death, while
over-watering can promote root rot and reduce soil aeration. This project utilizes a Raspberry
Pi microcontroller and a soil moisture sensor to measure soil moisture levels in real-time and
display or alert users about the moisture status. Unlike automated irrigation systems, this
project focuses solely on detecting and reporting soil moisture without any automatic watering
response. This setup is ideal for users looking to monitor soil conditions and make informed
watering decisions, and it provides a foundation for future enhancements such as automated
watering or Internet of Things (IoT) integration for remote monitoring.
